      "Summary": "The most recognized superhero in pop culture, Superman has been elevated to mythic folkhero status. Rocketed to Earth from the dying planet Krypton, baby Kal-El was found by a farming couple who named the boy Clark Kent and raised him as their own. Discovering his enormous powers, they instilled in him strong moral values, and inspired him to become a hero. Superman has super-everything: strength, speed, flight, invulnerability as well as his renowned X-ray and heat vision. The most powerful being on the planet, his amazing abilities are also a melancholy reminder of how different he is from the people he's dedicated to protect. A universal icon, Superman means different things to the many diverse people he inspires: He's an alien; an immigrant from a faraway land just looking to help; a country boy fighting the never-ending battle for truth and justice. And recent comics have truly spotlighted his role as the people's hero: Following a neophyte Man of Steel still learning his powers, limits, Superman fights the evil corporate tycoons and corrupt one-percenters that have overwhelmed the establishment."

Fueled by the uber-steroid serum known as Venom, Bane's strength is matched only by his intelligence. A master planner and strategist, he devoted his life to proving himself as the best. However, his quest for supremacy puts him directly at odds with the Dark Knight, whom Bane sees as the human embodiment of the law and order responsible for his captivity and torture as a child. Intriguingly, despite this hatred, Bane holds a much greater sense of respect for Gotham's guardian than most of his fellow villains, seeing Batman as his only real equal. But that equality comes at a price. The same serum that gives the villain his greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. Bane has developed an intense drug-like addiction to Venom and if deprived will go into severe withdrawal that could eventually culminate in madness. But if this will ultimately prove to be his downfall, it certainly hasn't yet."

Quite a feat, considering the loss of his parents, his rough childhood under a foster father and the physical changes brought to his skin and hair color due to the serum. Although he often uses his humor to hide the emotional pain he suffered from these hardships, the bonds he's formed with his fellow super heroes has lessened his pain, and he trusts and loves his friends completely."

Laughter from the audience made him resentful, so he took his bitterness and poured it into a life of crime, taking on the moniker of Captain Boomerang. Eventually, the law caught up with him, and Digger found himself looking at a life in prison. That is, of course, unless he joined the Suicide Squad for a chance at a pardon. It says a lot about your personality if the members of the Suicide Squad think you're dysfunctional, and that's probably one of the kinder words they'd use to describe Captain Boomerang. Selfish to the core, he doesn't look out for his teammates. He's rarely dependable and often annoying. And yet, to this day, he hasn't been booted from the team?"

Utilizing a cat mask and suit to steal from the city's rich and corrupt, she's a master at hand-to-hand combat and acrobatics, stealthy as a ninja and an expert at breaking and entering. However, despite her burglarious nature and antagonistic origins, Catwoman walks a fine line between hero and villain. She balances precariously on the precipice of good and evil, of doing the wrong thing for the arguably right reasons. And as such, Selina doesn't look at the world in black and white, but shades of gray. Guided by her own strict, if not slightly skewed, moral compass, Selina sometimes serves as one of the Dark Knight's closest allies. Their flirtatious relationship and complicated feelings for one another constantly push both in directions neither thought possible...or are always comfortable with. Particularly since there always looms the possibility that one day Catwoman will take her crimes too far, and Batman will have no choice but to see her behind bars."

It didn't take long for him to discover he had a gift for it, but he also learned the deadly price of the dark arts when his inexperience cost the life of another. Since then, Constantine has vowed mastery over the occult and the demonic creatures that seek to abuse its power. But in so doing, he's also learned the hard truth about what it takes to stand against powerful dark forces, a willingness to sacrifice anything and anyone. While Constantine prefers to bluff his way out of trouble by relying on subterfuge and slight of hand, he also never hesitates to lie, double-cross or hurt and betray those closest to him. But this apparent callousness masks an interesting truth about Constantine: If the fight against evil forces requires a willingness to sacrifice everything and everyone that you hold dear, then a hard attitude is likely necessary. Whether it's due to a sense of self-loathing, a resistance to any sort of authority or a deeply hidden desire to do what's right, Constantine is willing to make the hard choices, so that no one else has to."

But Gotham remains his primary home and Batman his biggest adversary, and no hero is perhaps better suited as in many ways, the Joker is the polar opposite of the Dark Knight. Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that life's a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change. Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people they've sworn to protect.

Later, Mari discovered that the mysterious Tantu Totem, the powerful necklace she inherited from her parents; granted her the ability to take on the attributes of every animal on Earth. She could fly like a hawk, breathe underwater like a fish and even strengthen her skin to the protective levels of a rhinoceros. Adopting the moniker Vixen, Mari seeks to protect and defend all innocents, humans and animals alike. Although short-tempered and sometimes overly self-righteous, Mari possesses compassion that gives her a strong and unwavering moral compass. Beyond her role as a super hero, she is a model and animal-rights activist, allowing her to use both aspects of her life to protect from humanity those creatures unable to protect themselves. Throughout her career as Vixen, she's fought along some of the greatest heroes in the DC Universe and has even served as a member of the Justice League."
